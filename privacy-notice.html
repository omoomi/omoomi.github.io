          <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Role-based access limited to minimum necessary personnel; multi-factor authentication required.</li>
          <li><strong>Breach Response:</strong> If we suspect a breach affecting 500+ individuals or PHI, we will notify affected users, HHS (per HIPAA §164.400), and regulators within 60 days. For smaller incidents, we notify within 30 days.</li>
