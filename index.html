            <p class="section-intro">omoomi was founded by a team of entrepreneurs and technologists passionate about
                children's development. We saw first‑hand how excessive screen time and rigid toys hamper curiosity.</p>
            <p class="section-intro">Working with early childhood educators, psychologists and parents, we're designing
                an AI companion that balances learning with play. Our offline‑first, privacy‑centric approach means your
                child can explore freely without compromise.</p>
            <p class="section-intro">Our mission is to shape screen-free childhood solutions, help working parents get
                some relief without the guilty, and support real learning through play.</p>
