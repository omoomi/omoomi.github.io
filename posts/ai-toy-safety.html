      <h2>The Alarming Discovery</h2>
      <p>The holiday season brings joy, wonder, and increasingly, a new kind of danger lurking beneath colorful packaging.
        Recent investigations into AI-powered toys have revealed a troubling reality: the cuddly teddy bear under your tree
        might be teaching your child about knives, matches, and sexually explicit content.</p>

      <p>The Public Interest Research Group <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TOYLAND-2025-11-14-7a.pdf"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tested four AI-enabled toys</a> this fall,
        and the results were alarming. The worst offender, an AI teddy bear, was caught instructing children where to find
        matches, knives, and pills. When researchers posed as children and asked about sensitive topics, the toy readily
        discussed sexual content, roleplay scenarios, and adult fetishes without any prompting. OpenAI has since suspended
        the toymaker's access to its models, and the company has pulled products from sale.</p>

      <p>Major media outlets including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/us/folotoy-ai-bear-suspended-explicit-advice.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>,
        <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/folotoy-kumma-ai-bear-scli-intl"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ai-teddy-bear-suspended-explicit-advice-b2868720.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Independent</a> have covered this story extensively, highlighting a
        critical failure point in how AI is being deployed in children's products. We at omoomi are encouraged to see this
        level of awareness being raised because parents deserve to understand the risks before bringing these devices into
        their homes.</p>

      <h2>Why This Matters for Your Family</h2>
      <p>The problem runs deeper than a few inappropriate responses. Most AI toys don't actually have their own "brain."
        Instead, they act as internet-connected microphones, sending your child's voice and questions to massive third-party
        language models in the cloud, the same ones designed for adult users, like ChatGPT. These models are trained on the
        vast, unfiltered internet and lack the age-appropriate guardrails children need.</p>

      <p>Beyond inappropriate content, there's a serious privacy dimension. Every conversation is recorded, digitized,
        and transmitted to servers you don't control. Researchers found that these toys are always listening, one even
        interrupting adult conversations during testing. Some store biometric voice data for years, processed by third
        parties with minimal oversight. In the event of a data breach, these recordings could be weaponized to clone a
        child's voice for scams targeting parents.</p>

      <h2>Our Difference: Built for Safety from the Ground Up</h2>
      <p>This is precisely why we created omoomi, but not as just another AI toy. We've built an entirely new category
        of personal learning device designed with two core principles: complete on-device processing and proprietary,
        age-appropriate AI models.</p>

      <h3>Full On-Device Intelligence</h3>
      <p>The "brain" of omoomi lives entirely within the device itself. Your child's voice, questions, and conversations
        are processed locally and never uploaded to our servers or anyone else's. This isn't just a privacy feature,
        it's an architectural choice that puts you in complete control. There are no recordings sent to third parties,
        no data mining, and no cloud vulnerabilities.</p>

      <h3>Purpose-Built for Children</h3>
      <p>We don't rely on generic chatbots trained on adult content. We design and train our own proprietary models on
        carefully vetted, age-appropriate knowledge bases. This means responses are not only safe but genuinely educational,
        encouraging curiosity without exposing children to harmful content. By controlling the entire AI pipeline, we can
        ensure the device remains a constructive presence in your child's development.</p>

      <h2>A New Era Where Privacy and Safety are Paramount</h2>
      <p>The conversation around AI toys has been dominated by fear and concern. We believe it's time for a new
        conversation, one centered on empowerment, safety, and trust. omoomi represents our commitment to building
        technology that truly serves families, not one that exploits them.</p>

      <p>For young learners, omoomi provides a protected window to explore the world, ask questions, and develop critical
        thinking skills in a curated environment free from ads, distractions, and dangers.</p>
